2/20/2026 16:28:47,Bean,5,3,4,5,Very useful. It's nice to have a piece of cloth I can use to clean things ups and discard when I'm done.,"I like slippers so much, I handmade my own pair of leather slippers. Stay warm my friends.",Not the brightest of critters. I recommend a dog. ,Nah - they don't exist.,Yes please!,
2/20/2026 16:31:14,Bob,5,1,5,5,It is soo useful and it can be applied to so many different concepts. It’s crazy how it’s actually not that complex to set up and it can transform your model’s capabilities.,They are a must. I served in Japan where they wore them throughout the house and it was life changing. Everyone needs some good slippers.,"I’m more of a dog person, but cats make funny videos for sure.","Super scary, if I ever met one I’d probably pass out.","I still eat it if it’s put in front of me, but I’m wishing it was milk chocolate.",
2/20/2026 16:36:14,Sam Darnold,5,3,4,5,RAG is a great resource for finding relevant information. I think any company that doesn't use RAG in some way is missing out.,"Slippers are the best, I can't go to sleep without having worn my slippers before bed.","I do not like cats, they play with their food too much, and are one of the most damaging animals to the environment.",The ROUS is dangerous and should be handled with care... is what I would have said if I actually thought that. They are over hyped and you can just outrun them easily.,Dark Chocolate is heavenly. It is the perfect balance of bitter and sweet.,
2/20/2026 17:38:21,Grok,5,5,1,5,RAG is great! It has real world applications unlike anything we’ve ever seen before in Agent Engineering.,Slippers are glorious.,Cats are a mistake by God. Also pickles. Pickles are disgusting. I was given the option to rate the 1 out of 5 above but that just wasn’t enough slander for the horrid thing that they are.,Questionable decision by God but we’re gonna roll with it.,Glorious. There is nothing on this earth quite as euphoric as dark chocolate. One of the greatest creations of mankind.,Interstellar
2/20/2026 17:50:26,Jacob ,3,1,2,4,It sounds like it solves everything,,,,,
2/21/2026 12:55:50,Jones,5,2,1,5,RAG is da' bomb,"Formerly yes, but not so much now",Cats are a nice concept but I'm not a big fan,,Oh absolutely. Dark chocolate is a gift from heaven.,The Star Wars universe
2/21/2026 13:43:59,Batman,4,4,1,5,I think RAG is cool. Being able to give the LLM data that wasn't included in its training is very helpful. But possibly a little overrated since it can just search the web anyways. Obviously it does have its uses though.,"Not very practical, impossible to walk backwards in. ",Worse than dogs but they do have my respect.,"I don't know anything about the Princess Bride, but I LOVE RATS",Only tastes good if you don't bite into it.,KPOP Demon Hunters
2/21/2026 16:35:18,Blake Calkins,5,3,3,5,"RAG is very cool. It has great amounts of uses, particularly to make chatbots useful and accurate on a given topic","Slippers are nice, but I don’t ever really wear them","I like cats, I think they’re cute, but I am allergic to them. ",I don’t think they exist. ,The darker the better,Wake up dead man
2/21/2026 20:43:25,Daphne,4,2,1,4,"RAG is a system that uses a specific type of database to look up additional information that it can feed into an LLM prompt. The database/datatype is uses is vector encodings, and the idea is that 'close' vectors represent similar ideas/meaning in the text. RAG is used to help specialize agents with specific tasks, overcome the knowledge-cutoff, and reduce hallucinations because of how it provides additional information.","Slippers are a shoe type that is meant to be worn indoors and without socks, to keep your feet warm. I've always found it hard to get good slippers. It's hard to get ones that fit the right way, and don't slip off, without being too tight. I feel like all the slippers I have always make my feet too warm, and then they sweat a lot which is uncomfortable.","Cats are a type of feline mammal that is generally considered a house pet. Cats are considered aloof, and mostly just do their own thing. I think cats are awesome. I would like a cat. If you get the right sort of cat, I'm sure it would be cuddly like a dog.","Haha, Princess Bride joke. They seem sort of terrifying, but it's been a while since I've seen that movie. It sort of feels like a dumb acronym. It would be more interesting if the name spelled out something real, like RATS or whatever.","Dark chocolate is a general category for a cacao ratio in chocolate. It represents the set of high cacao ratio. I think it's really tasty, as long as it's not bitter.","Somewhere between Star Wars, KPop Demon Hunters, Marvel, and Lord of The Rings"
2/22/2026 13:44:46,Spencer Zaugg,4,5,1,4,"Very Useful, it is good to be able to do some ""simple"" linear algebra and find related information, though it is important to chuck correctly to have something meaningful.","They are very comfortable, I usually don't wear them outside though because to me they are inside footwear.","House Cats are cute, though from my understanding they aren't as solitary as people are lead to believe, due to being descended from African wild cats, not European ones, African wild cats live in groups, European wild cats are solitary.","I would prefer not to encounter one as they are in the Princess Bride, though the real life Rodent of Unusual Size is the capybara, and I think they are cute.","I prefer sweeter chocolates, like milk chocolate, but as long as it isn't too dark I can still enjoy it.","Treasure Planet, it is just so good, adventure in space, pirates, character growth, it is a good movie, excellent animation as well. Unfortunately it was the last of the 2D animated movies, because 2D animators unionized and now it is cheaper to do 3D art, even if the 2D movies were stunning."
2/22/2026 17:38:28,Mae Evans,5,5,5,4,Makes so much sense and is such a genius idea to help agents answer based on correct information. Like basing opinions off of research when writing not just random opinions and internet garbage,"They are nice, I should get a new pair","Cute, but make me sneeze",I don’t think they exist,Wonderful. Better with ginger in it. Or salt.,Hunt for the wilderpeople
2/22/2026 18:27:39,Boston,5,5,4,4,"Super helpful for getting an accurate response on a specific topic, 10/10","Fantastic for the winter and when you gotta step out of the house for just a second, 10/10","Cuddly but not needy, super cute most of the time, 10/10",Pretty cool depending on the place. The Fire Swamp? 10/10. My living room? -5/10,"Too bitter for my liking, 5/10",Monsters Inc. Makes me cry every time
2/23/2026 7:45:26,Ernie,5,5,3,2,Rags are great for cleaning the house.,"Slippers are really comfy, particularly when you're wrapped up in a blanket.",**Decline to answer**,**Decline to answer**,The darker the better.,"Inception kinda hurt my head, but I liked the idea of a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream "
2/23/2026 14:14:40,Christian Gunn,4,5,4,5,Love it. I do wish that it could allow alteration of LLM writing conventions rather than solely convey information.,My toes are damaged from years of repeated frostbite. I wear a pair at home most of the time.,"I'm not allergic to them like I am dogs, but unless they're as affectionate as dogs I prefer dogs to them.","Capybara yes, swamp rats no.",The only chocolate to make hot chocolate out of.,Any movie bad enough that people won't get mad if I spend the whole film verbally making fun of it.
