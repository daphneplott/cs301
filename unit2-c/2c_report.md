This article listed multiple examples of RAG usage. Most of the examples were standard, using RAG in a basic way with LLMs to retrieve similar information. Overall, it was showing mostly that it improved accuracy of finding relevant information.

One usage was how DoorDash was using LLMs and RAG to help respond to the delivery people's issues. They use RAG to search for relevant articles and past cases, and then let the LLM summarize and tailor the information. One interesting thing it included was that it used multiple LLMs to help judge how useful the responses are.

Another usage was with LinkedIn. It didn't have a lot of details, but it said that it was using RAG on a knowledge graph instead of plain text.

This website is for NotebookLM, google's new tool that lets you input the sources you want to form a notebook of information. It doesn't specifically mention RAG, but it's clear that's what it's using to respond to each user's specific notebook sources. This is very similar to the example from the presenter in class. The way it uses RAG is to make the LLM an expert in one particular area. This also helps it to ground the information, and make sure its accurate.

This article was mostly about RAG in general, some of the general benefits and use cases.

One interesting benefit of RAG was the context size. It noted that RAG databases can hold a lot more information and context than most models. RAG is better at 'remembering' information. Another benefit was that RAG is useful for tracing sources, which an LLM might not be able to trace.

One of the use cases it listed was in email drafting. It included that grammarly can use RAG to adjust the tone of the email by including past interactions as data. I think this use of RAG is really interesting as a way to tailor AI agents to be better used by each individual.

One of the other uses was planning routes using RAG to give the AI real-time traffic data that it wouldn't have access to otherwise. A similar use case was in using RAG to access recently updated code libraries. These are good examples of using RAG to overcome the knowledge base cut off.
